Goal
----
The goal of this project is to implement a system to collect arbitrary data at physically diverse locations and wireless aggregate the data in a central location where it can be analyzed with common tools.

Operation
---------
1. Build and configure sensor node with appropriate sensor circuitry.
1. Program sensor node to read and advertise sensor data.
1. Deploy aggregation nodes and run a polling application to discover, log, and monitor sensor nodes.
1. Connect aggregation nodes to a central database to store readings from all sensor nodes.
1. Filter out duplicate readings from aggregation nodes that detect duplicate sensor nodes.
